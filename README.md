Purpl-GTK 3.26
---------------

A Very purple Gnome theme.

Installation:

NOTE: You must have the user themes extension enabled. This can be done easily with Gnome-Tweak-Tool.

Unzip purpl-gtk-master.zip and copy the purpl-gtk-master folder to /home/yourusername/.themes

Tip: Use Gnome-Tweak-Tool to change both your GTK and Shell themes.

Issues
------------
Seems to have funny issues after first setting the theme (e.g. red checkboxes), these go away after reboot.
